# react-activity-graph

_Note: this component is is unlikely to be actively developed in future; I recommend using [react-calendar-heatmap](https://github.com/patientslikeme/react-calendar-heatmap) instead._

This is a React component that can be used for activity graphs / calendar heatmaps (a la the GitHub contributions graph)

### Installation
```
npm install react-activity-graph --save
```

### Commands for development
- `npm start` - runs examples via react-cosmos
- `npm test` - runs tests w/ jest
- `npm run test:watch` - runs tests in watch mode
- `npm run build` - bundles a build using webpack from `src` -> `lib`

#### TODO
- Add month labels
- Resize correctly based on container size
- Rewrite tests
